= Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this set of Code Katas !

== Contribution Guide

=== Build policy

The Code Katas in this repository are arranged as independent maven projects that can be orchestrated or built together using the aggregator and *parent pom* pom.xml at the root of the project.
The parent pom (located at the root of the project) defines a few properties used throughout (such as the _JUnit version_ and the _Java compiler's source and target_ version).
In addition, some common build plugins are configured under the `pluginManagement` section of the parent pom.

==== REQUIREMENT: The individual Kata projects should remain independent build targets and should not depend on any other module or kata for a successful build.

=== Kata structure

Irrespective of the contribution style (a full module or enhancement/bug fix to existing module), here are some requirements:

==== General Project Structure

The project layout in the every Code Kata is similar.
Here is a tree structure to explain:

----
|____pom.xml                   <------------------- Project pom, using the java-katas/pom.xml as parent
|____README.md                 <------------------- Well documented README, with links to tests & solutions
|
|____src
| |
| |____test                    <------------------- Kata Tests
| | |____java
| |   |____none
| |     |____cvg
| |       |____<kata package>  <------------------- Name the package that corresponds to the kata.
| |       |____<kata pkg 2>    <------------------- Optional multiple packages if the kata covers more sections
| |
| |____main                    <------------------- Shared content (re-used in both tests and solutions)
| | |____java
| |   |____none
| |     |____cvg
| |
| |____solutions               <------------------- Solutions
| | |____java
| |   |____none
| |     |____cvg
| |       |____<kata package>  <------------------- Name the package that corresponds to the kata.
| |       |____<kata pkg 2>    <------------------- Optional multiple packages if the kata covers more sections
----

==== REQUIREMENT: The Code Kata project structure should comply with the setup of a `test` folder with failing tests and a `solution` folder with solved working tests.

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.

Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.
