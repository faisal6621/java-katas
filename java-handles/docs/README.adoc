Many Java libraries and frameworks currently use Reflection and Unsafe APIs.
With the newer modular Java some of these important tools of our trade may become  incompatible and/or may not work as desired.
In addition several enterprise applications  also rely on Core Reflection, (if not the use of Unsafe APIs).

== +++<a name="WhatIsACodeKata">++++++</a>+++What is a Code-Kata

A code-kata is a coding exercise that builds muscle memory by a practice of programming to arrive  at a known solution.

=== +++<a name="HowToSolveKata">++++++</a>+++How does one go about with this code kata?

The essence of the exercise (presentation material and code kata) is to demonstrate the alternates  for the current usage patterns for some of the simpler and more common usages of Java Reflection  API and the sun.misc.Unsafe among applications, libraries and frameworks.
An explanation of the  newer Handles API will be followed with code that allows for a comparison between using both styles.

This set of code katas rely on fixing broken tests.
The tests may have multiple solutions, the  intent is to learn and experiment.

The project contains several JUnit tests that fail with a message `"Test Failure - Fix all TODOs.
"`.

<span style="`color:green;`">**Here are simple steps to use this kata**</span>:

. Run the test class(es).
. One or more tests will fail with the test failure message, phrased above.
. Fix the failing tests by taking hints from the ``TODO``s.
. Repeat above steps until all tests pass.
. Check the solutions to see if there are other ways to solve.
(Remember, the solution may be less performant than yours)
. Rinse and repeat (delete and checkout again, then back to Step 1) to build muscle memory.

Each test class has two types of test methods:

* *Solved* test methods show how an invocation/access can be achieved with the traditional calls.
* *Unsolved/failing* test methods provide TODO hints that will allow the kata-taker to manually solve the exercise to  achieve the same with MethodHandles/VarHandles.

=== +++<a name="Mission">++++++</a>+++Mission

____
*_Your mission**, should you choose to accept it, will be to fix the JUnit tests to achieve the  same results with the Handles API as the solved one(s) do with traditional reflection.
This  message will self-destruct in_ **NaN* _minutes_

== +++<a name="TakeAway">++++++</a>+++Take Away

The key take-away from this kata is a solid understanding of the  simpler and more common usages of Core Reflection API and Unsafe API alongside the newer Handles  API both in similarity and in certain cases, how they differ.

Who knows if your next open source/enterprise contribution is with helping out a library, framework  or an enterprise application in converting to the newer APIs ?
