Most, if not all Java developers need to rely on Java date and time libraries.

== +++<a name="WhatIsACodeKata">++++++</a>+++What is a Code-Kata

A code-kata is a coding exercise that builds muscle memory by a practice of programming to arrive  at a known solution.

=== +++<a name="HowToSolveKata">++++++</a>+++How does one go about with this code kata?

The essence of the exercise (presentation material and code kata) is to demonstrate the + usage patterns for dates and times.

This set of code katas rely on fixing broken tests.
The tests may have multiple solutions, the  intent is to learn and experiment.

The project contains several JUnit tests that fail as `org.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError`.

<span style="`color:green;`">**Here are simple steps to use this kata**</span>:

. Run the test class(es).
. One or more tests will fail with the test failure message.
. Fix the failing tests by taking hints from the ``TODO``s.
. Repeat above steps until all tests pass.
. Check the solutions to see if there are other ways to solve.
(Remember, the solution may be less performant than yours)
. Rinse and repeat (delete and checkout again, then back to Step 1) to build muscle memory.

== +++<a name="JavaLambda">++++++</a>+++Java Lambda

The JUnit tests listed below are setup to teach/learn the Java Lambda features.

=== Tests Included

==== Java Lambda

. {blank}
+
===== link:src/test/java/none/cvg/lambdas/TestKata1LambdaBasics.java[TestKata1LambdaBasics]
+
The tests in this class show the basic features of lambdas in Java.
. {blank}
+
===== link:src/test/java/none/cvg/lambdas/TestKata2LambdasDeeperDive.java[TestKata2LambdasDeeperDive.java]
+
The tests in this class show the usage of `java.time.LocalDate`, `java.time.LocalTime`, `java.time.LocalDateTime` and `java.time.ZonedDateTime`.
In addition, this class introduces a `java.time.Clock` that is extremely handy in writing tests.
