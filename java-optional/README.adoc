Quite often, we have to test if a field or variable is `null` or has a value.
Conditional checks in traditional java relied on an if condition.
Failure to check and assumption of existence of a value can lead to the  ever-so-popular `NullPointerException`.

Sir Charles Anthony Richard Hoare (Tony Hoare), creator of the _null reference_  rued the creation of null in 2009:

____
I call it my billion-dollar mistake.
It was the invention of the null reference in 1965.
At that time, I was designing the first comprehensive type system for references in an  object oriented language (ALGOL W).
My goal was to ensure that all use of references  should be absolutely safe, with checking performed automatically by the compiler.
But I couldn't resist the temptation to put in a null reference, simply because it was  so easy to implement.
This has led to innumerable errors, vulnerabilities, and  system crashes, which have probably caused a billion dollars of pain and damage in  the last forty years.
____

Optional was added in Java 8 as a possible solution to errant null issues.
An Optional wrapper over a field or variable ensures there is a check or a deliberate attempt to get an value from  the wrapper.
The kata will help us better understand the features of `java.util.Optional`

== +++<a name="WhatIsACodeKata">++++++</a>+++What is a Code-Kata

A code-kata is a coding exercise that builds muscle memory by a practice of programming to arrive  at a known solution.

=== +++<a name="HowToSolveKata">++++++</a>+++How does one go about with this code kata?

The essence of the exercise (presentation material and code kata) is to demonstrate the + usage patterns for dates and times.

This set of code katas rely on fixing broken tests.
The tests may have multiple solutions, the  intent is to learn and experiment.

The project contains several JUnit tests that fail as `org.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError`.

<span style="`color:green;`">**Here are simple steps to use this kata**</span>:

. Run the test class(es).
. One or more tests will fail with the test failure message.
. Fix the failing tests by taking hints from the ``TODO``s.
. Repeat above steps until all tests pass.
. Check the solutions to see if there are other ways to solve.
(Remember, the solution may be less performant than yours)
. Rinse and repeat (delete and checkout again, then back to Step 1) to build muscle memory.
